### Hipergator Setup (Allow 2 Week Lead-Time)
To offer a unix class on Hipergator, open a [support ticket](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/help/support-requests/).  Coordinate all training with Matt Gitzendanner.  Click on Accounts & Resources and then login using your UF name/password.  In the Summary field, type "Course Allocation".  In the description field, request the number of cores you'd like for the class (one processor per student).  Typically need 4 cores per student.  MyTraining provides the email addresses for the attendees.  Copy and paste the email addresses into the Description field.  Also indicate the date(s) for the class, noting that all registered students will need to have access to the hsc_lib_workshop folder.  Expect an email from bugzilla-daemon@bugzilla.hpc.ufl.edu confirming receipt of the request.  You will continue to receive emails from them until the workshop has been offered.

- Tell students that their Hipergator accounts will be wiped so all workshop-related materials need to be moved to a safe location.
- Students with existing Research Computing accounts will not have new accounts created for them.
- The shared workshop folder is: /ufrc/hsc_lib_workshop.  When a new workshop is created, it is added to your id.  Type `id` to view it.
- Use MobaXterm (Portable edition) for unix access -- Download it [here](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html).
- Space Invaders is available on MobaXterm.
- 1st class should cover Hipergator policies.
