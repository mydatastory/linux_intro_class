### Introduction to Linux

### Hipergator Setup (2 weeks in advance of class)
To offer a unix class on Hipergator, open a support ticket at https://www.rc.ufl.edu/help/support-requests/.  Click on Accounts & Resources, then login using your UF name/password.  In the Summary field, type "Course Allocation".  In the description field, request the number of cores you'd like for the class (one processor per student).  Typically need 8 cores per student.  MyTraining provides the email addresses for the attendees.  Copy and paste the email addresses into the Description field.  Also indicate the date(s) for the class.  Indicate that all registered students will need to have access to the hsc_lib_workshop folder.

The shared workshop folder is: /ufrc/hsc_lib_workshop.  When a new workshop is created, it is added to your id.  Type `id` to view your assignments.  

- Tell students that their Hipergator accounts will be wiped so all workshop-related materials need to be moved to a safe location.
